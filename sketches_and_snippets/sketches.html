                <p>Neural Networks comprise of an ordered list of matrices with interspersed non-linear functions.
                    Every matrix is, in general, <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/matrices-probability-graphs"
                        target="_blank">equivalent to a weighted bipartite graph</a>.
                    Therefore, a neural network can be viewed as an ordered list of weighted bipartite graphs.
                    Can we use this correspondence to translate the tools developed in Graph Theory to aid our
                    understanding of Neural Networks? What does Ford-Fulkerson have to say, if anything, about how information flows

                <h4>Proving Theorems is an Exercise in Breadth First Search</h4>
                <h6><span class="conference cvpr">SKETCH</span> August 11, 2023 </h6>
                <p>
                    Mathematical ideas (definitions, theorems ...), can be thought of as nodes in a directed
                    graph depicting the entailment relationships among them. When equipped with such an entailment
                    graph, proving a theorem becomes an exercise in searching for a path between some two particular
                    nodes.
                    To prove a theorem, we start by exploring nodes in the neighborhood of our proposition.
                    We systematically expand our search until we find the node corresponding to our conclusion. Since most 
                    theorems would include multiple nodes as starting points (i.e multiple premises), we could also think in terms
                    paths from meta-nodes to nodes,
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    With this framework, we can note the following: First, different proofs to the same theorem
                    correspond to different paths between the same pair of nodes. Secondly, learning mathematics,
                    is the act of building a mental version of this entailment graph.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This general idea can be extended beyond logical reasoning to encompass

                    by equipping each edge with a non-negative weight representing the degree to which we believe that
                    the source entails the destination.

                <h4>On The Audible Rhyme</h4>

                <p>
                    There's a sense in which the process by which these Neural Networks are generated is similar to the
                    process
                    through which complex biological black boxes (otherwise known as organisms) are generated. More
                    specifically, there is an audible rhyme between backpropagation mediated model training via error
                    minimization and organismal evolution via natural selection. Evidently, both processes produce
                    systems that
                    demonstrate remarkable, useful traits. Further, both processes involve the
                    search through some abstract fitness landscape in order to find 'fit' models/organisms.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Setting aside the philosophical question of whether deep learning models are like organisms (they
                    clearly aren't), what can we gain if we treat them as though they were? What, empirical, questions
                    can we ask of them? Within Biology, we have developed a rich set of experimental ideas, methods, and
                    tools in our quest to understand and interpret biological black boxes (i.e organisms and the cells
                    that comprise them). Is it possible to use these ideas, tools, and techniques to develop a general
                    framework for understanding and interpreting trained Neural Networks?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Concretely, can we draw inspiration from Molecular Biology to design experiments geared towards
                    answering the following questions?
                    <li>Do the weights of neural networks, that is, the networks' learned representations, contain
                        functional modules? </li>
                    <li>Are these functional modules, if they exist, associated, in some fashion, to the traits
                        exhibited by the trained networks? </li>
                    <li>Can we isolate these functional modules, if they exist, and confirm their association to
                        particular traits through Gain or Loss of function experiments?</li>

When we have intuitively understood some simple propositions ... it is useful to go through
them with a continuous, uninterrupted motion of thought, to meditate upon their mutual
relations, and to conceive, distinctly, several of them — as many as possible — simultaneously.
In this manner, our knowledge will grow more certain, and the capacity of the mind will
notably increase.

Mathematics is regarded as a demonstrative science. Yet, this is only one of its aspects.
Finished mathematics presented in a finished form appears as purely demonstrative, consisting
of proofs only. Yet, mathematics in the making resembles any other human knowledge in the
making. You have to guess a mathematical theorem before you can prove it [that is, you have
to come up with a conjecture]. You have to guess the idea of the proof before you carry
through the details; You have to combine observations and follow analogies; ... the result
of the mathematician's creative work is demonstrative reasoning; but, the proof is discovered
by plausible reasoning, by guessing.

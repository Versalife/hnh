        <h1>String Indexing: A Rust Implementation</h1>

        <section>
            <p>In this article, we discuss two structures that are foundational to tasks
                that need to do substring matching: The Suffix Array and The Longest Common Prefix Array. We'll explore
                two
                linear time procedures (SA-IS & Kasai's Algorithm) for constructing these data structures given some
                underlying, fairly static string from some alphabet $\Sigma$.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Substring Search</h2>

            <p>A string $\alpha$ with length $n$ is said to be a substring of another string $\Omega$ with length $m
                \text{ and } n \leq m$ if, an only if $\alpha$ is a prefix of some suffix of $\Omega$. This is the basic
                insight that explains why we would want to construct a suffix array. Before we proceed any further, we
                need to explain what a suffix array is.</p>

            <p>A suffix array for some string $\Omega$ is an array of all the suffixes of that string. Note that, since
                a suffix is fully defined by its starting index in the string, there are $m + 1$ possible suffixes
                (where the extra 1 comes from counting the empty suffix). This array is sorted lexicographically. To
                save space, suffix arrays do not store the full suffixes, instead, they only store the starting index of
                each suffix. To sum up, a suffix array for some string is a lexicographically sorted array of all the
                indexes of all suffixes in the underlying string.</p>

            <p>Finally, most algorithms that operate on strings assume that each string has a sentinel character
                appended at the end. This sentinel character should not appear anywhere else in the string and should be
                lexicographically smaller than all characters that could appear in the string. For the ASCII alphabet,
                we often use the character <code>$</code> as the sentinel.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Suffix Array: A Naïve Solution via Sorting</h2>

            <p>How can we create the suffix array? The most straightforward way would be to first generate all possible
                suffixes, then sort them lexicographically. This runtime of this approach is at least
                <code>m lg m</code> as that is the comparison-based sorting lower bound.
            </p>

            <p>For instance, suppose out string is, $\Omega = \text{banana}$. We would start by appending the sentinel
                at the end to get $\Omega' = \text{banana\$}$. Then we would generate all the 7 different suffixes of
                the string in linear time by doing a single scan over the string. This would give us the table on the
                left below:

            $$
            \begin{array}{lr}
            \hline \text{start index} & \text{suffix} \\ \hline
            0 & \text{banana}\$ \\
            1 & \text{anana}\$ \\
            2 & \text{nana}\$ \\
            3 & \text{ana}\$ \\
            4 & \text{na}\$ \\
            5 & \text{a}\$ \\
            6 & \$ \\
            \hline
            \end{array}
            \quad\quad % Adds some space between the tables
            \begin{array}{lr}
            \hline \text{start index} & \text{suffix} \\ \hline
            6 & \$ \\
            5 & \text{a}\$ \\
            3 & \text{ana}\$ \\
            1 & \text{anana}\$ \\
            0 & \text{banana}\$ \\
            4 & \text{na}\$ \\
            2 & \text{nana}\$ \\
            \hline
            \end{array}
            $$
            </p>

            <p>We would then sort these suffixes to get the table on the right. The start index column of that table is
                the suffix array. Right off the bat, we can notice a few salient features about the suffix array. these
                features are the source of its utility. First, notice that all suffixes that start with the same
                character occupy a contiguous slice in the array. In fact, all suffixes that begin with the same prefix
                are all next to one another.</p>

            <p>We implement this scheme below.</p>

            <pre><code class="language-rust">
//! We will be working with indexes to different arrays a lot. Having many
//! raw indexes flying around increases the cognitive load as it requires
//! one to be super vigilant not to use an index of one array in another different array.
//! To solve this problem, we use the `NewType Index Pattern`. By giving each index
//! a concrete type, we offload the cognitive load to the compiler.

/// This is an index into the underlying string
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Clone)]
pub struct SuffixIndex(usize);

/// To make things even more ergonomic, we implement the `Index` trait to allow
/// us to use our new type without retrieving the wrapped index. For now,
/// We assume that our string will be a collection of bytes. That is of course
/// the case for the ascii alphabet
impl std::ops::Index&lt;SuffixIndex&gt; for [u8] {
    type Output = u8;
    fn index(&amp;self, index: SuffixIndex) -&gt; &amp;Self::Output {
        &amp;self[index.0]
    }
}

pub struct SuffixArray&lt;'a&gt; {
    /// The string over which we are building this suffix array
    underlying: &amp;'a str,

    /// The suffix array is simply all the suffixes of the
    /// underlying string in sorted order
    suffix_array: Vec&lt;SuffixIndex&gt;,
}

/// This is an index into the suffix array
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Clone, Ord, PartialOrd)]
pub struct SuffixArrayIndex(usize);

/// This allows us to easily retrieve the suffix strings by using bracket
/// notation.
impl &lt;'a&gt; std::ops::Index&lt;SuffixArrayIndex&gt; for SuffixArray&lt;'a&gt;  {
    type Output = str;
    fn index(&amp;self, index: SuffixArrayIndex) -&gt; &amp;Self::Output {
        let suffix_idx = &amp;self.suffix_array[index.0];
        &amp;self.underlying[suffix_idx.0..]
    }
}
</code></pre>

            <p>With these abstractions in place, we can go ahead and implement our naive SACA.</p>

            <pre><code class="language-rust">
impl&lt;'a&gt; SuffixArray&lt;'a&gt; {
    /// Construct the suffix array by sorting. This has worst case performance
    /// of O(n log n)
    pub fn make_sa_by_sorting(s: &amp;'a str) -&gt; Self {
        let mut suffixes = vec![];
        for i in 0..s.len() {
            suffixes.push(&amp;s[i..]);
        }
        suffixes.sort();
        let mut suffix_array = vec![];
        for suffix in suffixes {
            let cur = SuffixIndex(s.len() - suffix.len());
            suffix_array.push(cur);
        }
        Self {
            underlying: s,
            suffix_array,
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

            <p>Now that we our suffix array, how can we use it to do substring search? In particular, suppose that we
                build a suffix array for the string $\Omega, |\Omega| = m$ and we want to finds all places that another
                query string $\alpha, |\alpha| = n$ occurs in the first string. How fast can we do this? one approach
                would be to use two binary searches to find the left and right region in the suffix array where our
                query string occurs. We'll have to make at least $\lg m$ comparisons. To fully characterize the runtime,
                we need to figure out how long each comparison takes. If each lexicographic comparison is implemented by
                linear scanning, then thr runtime to find the boundaries will be $O(n \lg m)$. Do note that it is
                possible to implement string comparisons in near constant time using word-level parallelism tachniques
                that are at the heart of <a
                    href="https://github.com/jlikhuva/blog/blob/main/posts/integer.md">specialized containers for
                    integers</a>. Once we know the boundaries of our region of interest, we can simply retrieve the
                mathching locations by doing a linear scan. If we have $z$ matches, the total runtime for this scheme
                becomes $O(n \lg m + z)$. We leave the implementation details as an exercise to the reader.</p>

            <h2>The LCP Array: Kasai's Procedure</h2>

            <p>Suffix arrays are fairly useful on their own. However, they become even more useful when coupled with
                information about the lengths of common prefixes. In particular, the time to do substring matching is
                greatly reduced if we know the length of the longest common prefixes between all pairs of adjacent
                suffixes in the suffix array. How can we get that information? We explore that here.</p>

            <h3>A Naive Solution</h3>

            <p> Given a suffix array, the most straightforward way to construct an LCP array is to scan over the
                elements of the array, calculating the lengths of common prefixes for all adjacent suffixes. We
                implement that below.</p>

            <pre><code class="language-rust">
/// The length of the longest common prefix between the
/// suffixes that start at `left` and `right`. These
/// suffixes are adjacent to each other in the suffix array
#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct LCPHeight {
    left: SuffixIndex,
    right: SuffixIndex,
    height: usize,
}

impl&lt;'a&gt; SuffixArray&lt;'a&gt; {
    /// Retrieve the index of the suffix stored at this location
    /// in the suffix array. Put another way, we retrieve the id
    /// of the (idx + 1) smallest suffix in the string
    pub fn get_suffix_idx_at(&amp;self, idx: usize) -&gt; SuffixIndex {
        // These clones are quite cheap
        self.suffix_array[idx].clone()
    }
    // Add a helper to get length for Vec::with_capacity
    pub fn len(&amp;self) -&gt; usize {
        self.suffix_array.len()
    }
}

/// Calculate the length of the longest common prefix
/// between the two string slices in linear time
fn calculate_lcp_len(left: &amp;str, right: &amp;str) -&gt; usize {
    let mut len = 0;
    for (l, r) in left.as_bytes().iter().zip(right.as_bytes()) {
        if l != r {
            break;
        }
        len += 1;
    }
    len
}

/// The naive procedure described in the preceding section
fn make_lcp_by_scanning(sa: &amp;SuffixArray) -&gt; Vec&lt;LCPHeight&gt; {
    let mut lcp_len_array = Vec::with_capacity(sa.len());
    for i in 1..sa.len() {
        let prev_sa_idx = SuffixArrayIndex(i - 1);
        let cur_sa_idx = SuffixArrayIndex(i);
        let lcp_len = calculate_lcp_len(&amp;sa[prev_sa_idx], &amp;sa[cur_sa_idx]);
        lcp_len_array.push(LCPHeight {
            left: sa.get_suffix_idx_at(i - 1),
            right: sa.get_suffix_idx_at(i),
            height: lcp_len,
        });
    }
    lcp_len_array
}
</code></pre>

            <p>How fast is this procedure? Well, clearly it takes at least $O(n)$. To get a tighter bound, we need to
                investigate the worst case behavior of the inner loop that calculates the <code>LCP</code> between two
                suffixes. Suppose that the two strings are identical except that one is one character shorter than the
                other. In that case, the inner loop will iterate $n-1$ times. This means that the runtime of this
                procedure is $O(n^2)$. This is bad. Do note that the example used is not a degenerate case, it is quite
                likely to occur when dealing with really long strings (for example 3 billion characters) from a really
                small alphabet (for instance $\Sigma = 4$). We need a faster method.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://web.cs.iastate.edu/~cs548/references/linear_lcp.pdf">Kasai's Procedure</a></h3>

            <p>The main reason why the naive solution is sub-optimal is the inner loop. If we could somehow reduce the
                time needed to compute <code>LCP</code> values, we could markedly improve the overall runtime. The first
                thing to observe is that when implementing the naïve procedure, we iterated over the suffix array -- not
                the underlying string. Because of this, we are unable to exploit the fact that the only difference
                between two suffixes $S_i, \text{ and } S_{i + 1}$ that are adjacent to each other <em>in the
                    string</em> is that one has one more character at the start. Suppose we have already found the
                <code>lcp</code> length between $S_i$ and the $S_k$, a suffix adjacent to it <em>in the suffix
                    array</em>, to be $h > 1$. How can we use this information to calculate the lcp length between $S_{i
                +1}$ and $S_j$, the suffix adjacent to it in the suffix array? The key insight stems from observing that
                if we delete the first character from $S_i$ we get $S_{i +1}$, and since $h > 1$ deleting that character
                from $S_j$ yields another suffix that is adjacent to $S_{i +1}$ with overlap in at least $h-1$ location.
                Therefore, to calculate the <code>lcp</code> between the shorter suffixes, we do not need to compare the
                first $h-1$ suffixes for we already know that they are the same. This effectively reduces the number of
                times the inner loop iterates and results in a linear time solution. See the linked paper for a proof of
                correctness and runtime analysis. We implement this scheme below.

            <h2>The Suffix Array: A Linear Time Solution[WIP]</h2>

            <p>In the first section, we implemented a suffix array construction algorithm (SACA) that worked by sorting
                the suffixes. During that discussion, we noted that the runtime of that scheme is lower bounded by the
                time it takes to sort the suffixes. For long sequences, this time can be quite large. For example, we
                may want to build a suffix array of the human genome approx: 3 bilion characters. Can we do better? <a
                    href="https://github.com/jlikhuva/blog/blob/main/posts/rmq.md#the-method-of-four-russians">Can we
                    shave off a log factor</a>? Yes. Yes we can. We won't use the method of four russians though (I
                should note that sometimes whenever I stare at SA-IS, the algorithm we're about to discuss, I'm almost
                convinced that it can be characterized using the method of four russians).</p>

            <h3><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4976463">SA-IS: A suffix array via Induced Sorting</a>
            </h3>

            <p>What is <code>induced sorting?</code> and how does it differ from normal sorting? The word
                <code>induce</code> in the title of this procedure refers to inductive reasoning or, more plainly,
                inference. <code>induced sorting</code> is thus sorting by inference. Note that I'm using the term
                <code>inference</code> in its natural language sense, not its statistical sense. As we shall see, in
                induced sorting, we are able to infer the order of certain suffixes once we know the order of some
                specific suffixes. This means that we can sort without comparisons and can thus beat the $n \lg n$ lower
                bound that hamstrung the naive SACA method.
            </p>

            <h4>Foundational Concepts</h4>
            <p>Below, we briefly discuss some key ideas that we need in order to fully understand the SA-IS procedure.
            </p>

            <p><strong>L-Type & S-Type Suffixes:</strong> A suffix starting at some position $k$ in some text $T$ is an
                <code>S-type</code> suffix if: $T[k] < T[k + 1]$ OR $T[k]==T[K + 1] \text{ AND } k + 1 \text{ is an
                    S-type suffix}$ OR $T[k]=\text{\$}$, the sentinel character. Similarly, A suffix starting at some
                    position $k$ in some text $T$ is an <code>L-type</code> suffix if $T[k] > T[k + 1]$ OR $T[k] == T[K
                    + 1] \text{ AND } k + 1 \text{ is an L-type suffix}$.
            </p>

            <p><strong>LMS Suffixes and Substrings:</strong> An <code>S</code> type suffix is said to be a Left Most
                S-suffix (LMS suffix for short) if it is an <code>S</code> type suffix that has an <code>L</code> type
                suffix as its left neighbor. The sentinel <code>$</code> is an <code>LMS</code> suffix by definition. An
                <code>LMS substring</code> is a contiguous slice of the underlying string that starts at the starting
                index of some <code>LMS</code> suffix and runs up to the start of the next, closest <code>LMS</code>
                suffix.
            </p>

            <p>What's the purpose of all these concepts? Well, SA-IS is based on two key ideas. The first one is that if
                we know the locations of the <code>LMS</code> suffixes in the suffix array, then we can infer the
                location of all the other suffixes (induced sorting). The second one is divide and conquer. Since SA-IS
                is a divide an conquer method it needs a way of reducing the problem space. This is called
                <code>substring renaming</code> in the literature. Since <code>LMS</code> suffixes are sparsely
                distributed in a string, SA-IS leverages the substrings that they produce (<code>LMS Substrings</code>)
                to reduce the problem size. We shall discuss how <code>substring renaming</code> is done later on. For
                now, let us introduce abstractions that allow us to work with the concepts we have seen so far.

            <p><strong>Buckets:</strong> A bucket is a contiguous region of the suffix array where all suffixes begin
                with the same character. That starting character serves as the label for that bucket. Buckets are
                important in SA-IS because, as we'll soon see, we use them for induced sorting. Specifically, by placing
                <code>LMS</code> suffixes in their buckets at the right locations, we are able to infer the appropriate
                locations of the other suffixes in those buckets. Below we introduce the abstraction for a bucket
            </p>

            <p><strong>The Alphabet $\Sigma$</strong>: An alphabet, simply put, is the ordered unique list of all the
                characters that can ever appear in our strings. For instance, if our problem domain is genomics, then
                our alphabet could be <code>{A, T, U, C, G}</code>. If it is proteomics, the alphabet could be the 20
                amino acids. For our case, our alphabet is the <code>256</code> ascii characters. To create a bucket, we
                need to know where it starts and where it ends. For each unique character in the underlying string, we
                can obtain this information by leveraging the associated alphabet to implement a modified version of
                counting sort. In particular, we start by keeping a count of how many times each character appears in
                the underlying string — just as we do in counting sort. We then scan across this array of counts using
                the count information to generate our buckets. We implement this functionality below.</p>

            <p><strong>Induced Sorting Part One:</strong> Once we know the nature of all our suffixes and the locations
                of all our buckets, we can begin slotting suffixes in place. First, we place all <code>lms</code>
                suffixes in their buckets. Because they are <code>S</code> type suffixes, we now that they will occupy
                the latter portions of their respective buckets. Why is this so? Well, think about how the suffixes in a
                given bucket compare if we exclude the first character. Once we have all the lms suffixes in position,
                we proceed to place L type suffixes at their appropriate location, after which we do the same for S type
                suffixes. We implement this logic below.</p>

            <p><strong>Substring Renaming:</strong> In substring renaming, we'd like to reduce the size of our input. We
                do so by forming a new string out of our <code>LMS substrings</code>. That is, all the characters that
                belong to a single substring are reduced to a single label. We implement substring renaming below.</p>

            <p>After obtaining the shorter substring, we check to see if it contains any repeated labels. If it does
                not, then we are done, we can go ahead and create a suffix array for the reduced string. If it contains
                duplicates, we recurse on the reduced string and alphabet. In the next section we discuss how to compute
                the suffix array given the suffix array of the reduced string.</p>

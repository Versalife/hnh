I feel it necessary to apologize in advance for what I'm now going to discuss. No one likes
to come down from the top of a tall building, from where vistas and panoramas are visible,
and inspect a windowless basement. We know, intellectually, that there could be no panoramas
without the basement, but emotionally, we feel no desire to look at it directly; indeed, we
feel an aversion. Above all, there's no beauty; there are only dark corners and dampness and
airlessness. It is sufficient to know that the building stands on it, that its supports, its
pipes, and plumbing are in place and functioning.

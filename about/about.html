            <h1 id="about-me">About the Author</h2>
            <p>To use Tufte CSS, copy <code>tufte.css</code> and the <code>et-book</code> directory of font files to
                your project directory, then add the following to your HTML document’s <code>head</code> block:</p>
            <p><label for="mn-figure-1" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-figure-1"
                    class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img src="../napkins/img/rhino.png"
                        alt="Image of a Rhinoceros" /> F.J. Cole, “The History of Albrecht Dürer’s Rhinoceros in
                    Zooological Literature,” <em>Science, Medicine, and History: Essays on the Evolution of Scientific
                        Thought and Medical Practice</em> (London, 1953), ed. E. Ashworth Underwood, 337-356. From page
                    71 of Edward Tufte’s <em>Visual Explanations</em>.</span> But tight integration of graphics with
                text is central to Tufte’s work even when those graphics are ancillary to the main body of a text. In
                many of those cases, a margin figure may be most appropriate. To place figures in the margin, just wrap
                an image (or whatever) in a margin note inside a <code>p</code> tag, as seen to the right of this
                paragraph.</p>

            <h1 id="about-the-site"> About this Site</h2>
            <p>Links in Tufte CSS match the body text in color and do not change on mouseover or when clicked. Here is a
                <a href="#">dummy example</a> that goes nowhere. These links are underlined, since this is the most
                widely recognized indicator of clickable text. 
                
                <label for="mn-blue-links"
                    class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-blue-links"
                    class="margin-toggle" />

                <span class="marginnote">Blue text, while also a widely recognizable
                    clickable-text indicator, is crass and distracting. Luckily, it is also rendered unnecessary by the
                    use of underlining.</span>
                    
                    However, because most browsers’ default underlining does not clear
                descenders and is so thick and distracting, the underline effect is instead achieved using CSS trickery
                involving background gradients instead of standard <code>text-decoration</code>. Credit goes to Adam
                Schwartz for that technique.

            <h1 id="about-name">About the Name</h2>
            <p>If you’d like to introduce your page or a section of your page with some quotes, use epigraphs. Modeled
                after chapter epigraphs in Tufte’s books (particularly <em>Beautiful Evidence</em>), these are
                <code>blockquote</code> elements with a bit of specialized styling. Quoted text is italicized. The
                source goes in a <code>footer</code> element inside the <code>blockquote</code>. We have provided three
                examples in the epigraph of this section, demonstrating shorter and longer quotes, with and without a
                paragraph tag, and showing how multiple quotes within an epigraph fit together with the use of a wrapper
                class.

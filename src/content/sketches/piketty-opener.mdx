Every human society must justify its inequalities: unless reasons for them are found, the
whole political and social edifice stands in danger of collapse. Every epoch, therefore,
develops a range of contradictory discourses and ideologies for the purpose of legitimizing
the inequality that already exists or the people believe should exist. ... In today's
societies, these justificatory narratives comprise themes of property, entrepreneurship,
and meritocracy ...

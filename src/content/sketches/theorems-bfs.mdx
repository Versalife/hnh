Mathematical ideas (definitions, theorems ...) can be thought of as nodes in a directed graph
depicting the entailment relationships among them. When equipped with such an entailment graph,
proving a theorem becomes an exercise in searching for a path between some two particular nodes.
To prove a theorem, we start by exploring nodes in the neighborhood of our proposition. We
systematically expand our search until we find the node corresponding to our conclusion. Since
most theorems would include multiple nodes as starting points (i.e. multiple premises), we could
also think in terms of paths from meta-nodes to nodes.

With this framework, we can note the following: First, different proofs to the same theorem
correspond to different paths between the same pair of nodes. Secondly, learning mathematics
is the act of building a mental version of this entailment graph.

This general idea can be extended beyond logical reasoning to encompass
[plausible reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_reasoning) by equipping each
edge with a non-negative weight representing the degree to which we believe that the source
entails the destination.

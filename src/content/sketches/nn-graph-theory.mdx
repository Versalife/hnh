Neural Networks comprise an ordered list of matrices with interspersed non-linear functions.
Every matrix is, in general, [equivalent to a weighted bipartite graph](https://www.math3ma.com/blog/matrices-probability-graphs).
Therefore, a neural network can be viewed as an ordered list of weighted bipartite graphs.
Can we use this correspondence to translate the tools developed in Graph Theory to aid our
understanding of Neural Networks? What does Ford-Fulkerson have to say, if anything, about
how information flows through a neural network?
